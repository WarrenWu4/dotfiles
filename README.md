# dotfiles

packages used:
- vs code (installed from aur instead of pacman)
- kitty (terminal emulator)
- zsh + oh-my-zsh (as shell)
- pavucontrol (for audio)

move .tmux and .tmux.conf and .zshrc to root dir
2 oh-my-zsh themes (make sure to add to ~/.oh-my-zsh/themes/)
also next time don't be an idiot and fucking push all of .tmux to github ðŸ’€ shit takes forever to clone
